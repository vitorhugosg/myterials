It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the\r\n                    same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesques distort their letterforms\r\n                    to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their\r\n                    natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and\r\n                    serif types.</p>\r\n            </blockquote>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n    <!--Section: Headings-->\r\n    <section>\r\n\r\n        <!--Grid row-->\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n            <!--Grid column-->\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-md-12\">\r\n\r\n                <h4 class=\"mt-4 mb-5 font-weight-bold dark-grey-text\"><strong>Standard</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n                <h1>h1. heading</h1>\r\n\r\n                <hr>\r\n\r\n                <h2>h2. heading</h2>\r\n\r\n                <hr>\r\n\r\n                <h3>h3. heading</h3>\r\n\r\n                <hr>\r\n\r\n                <h4>h4. heading</h4>\r\n\r\n                <hr>\r\n\r\n                <h5>h5. heading</h5>\r\n\r\n                <hr>\r\n\r\n                <h6>h6. heading</h6>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            <!--Grid column-->\r\n\r\n            <!--Grid column-->\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-md-6\">\r\n\r\n                <h4 class=\"mt-4 mb-5 font-weight-bold dark-grey-text\"><strong>Classes</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n                <p class=\"h1\">h1.
